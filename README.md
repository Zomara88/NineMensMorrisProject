A project developed as part of an AI course, where an algorithm is trained to play a variation of Nine Men's Morris. 
The rules are as follows:
The objective of the game is to form as many mills (lines of three pieces) as possible, thereby gaining the ability to remove your opponent's pieces from the board. The player who reduces their opponent to two pieces or blocks them from making a move wins.
The game begins with an empty board. The players determine who plays first and then take turns. During the first phase, a player's turn consists of placing a piece (black or white) from the player's hand onto an empty point. If a player is able to place three pieces in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, they have formed a mill, which allows them to remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board.
If a player is reduced to three pieces, they can "hop" their piece to any empty point on the board, not just adjacent points. This rule adds a strategic element as the player with fewer pieces gains increased mobility.
Separate programs were made to play the opening of the game, where pieces are being placed on the board. Another program will execute the middle and endgame. Variations in the programs include training using alpha-beta pruning and q-learning.
